# Remote Agent Control

This context defines the concepts used to control persistent Pi agent sessions remotely through Telegram while preserving repository and workspace safety.

## Language

**Remote control**:
An explicitly started Telegram connection to the currently running Pi process. It is inactive until `/rc` is started and ends when `/rc stop`, `/rc logout`, or Pi shutdown stops it.
_Avoid_: daemon, always-on service

**Agent session**:
A persistent Pi conversation associated with one repository, one Git worktree, one branch, and one Telegram forum topic.
_Avoid_: subagent, task

**Workspace**:
The Git worktree in which an agent session reads and modifies files. Concurrent agent sessions never share a workspace.
_Avoid_: checkout, folder

**Repository**:
An approved local project path that remote control may expose to agent sessions.
_Avoid_: arbitrary path

**Session topic**:
A private Telegram forum topic representing one agent session. It carries prompts, progress, approvals, and results for that session.
_Avoid_: channel, thread

**Control topic**:
The private Telegram forum topic used for repository and session management rather than agent work.
_Avoid_: admin chat

**Repository registry**:
The local allowlist of repositories that remote control may use. Starting `/rc` in a repository registers that repository for the current control session.
_Avoid_: workspace list

**Remote bridge**:
The temporary process inside Pi that translates Telegram messages and UI interactions into Pi session operations. It is started explicitly by `/rc` and is not an independent background service.
_Avoid_: bot server

**Cleanup**:
An explicit, independently confirmed operation that archives a Telegram topic, removes Pi session history, or removes a Git worktree and branch. Cleanup never happens implicitly because an agent becomes idle.
_Avoid_: delete, reset
